Many people can arrive at a great idea and begin to execute on it, but a differentiating factor can come down to a founder having the right qualities and experience to grow in that market exponentially faster.

For example, when you’re unsure of what to do, the scientific method is a fantastic framework for testing your own hypothesis, and not relying on Google and someone else’s thoughts. Now take this framework, and use it as a foundation for other frameworks. Critical mass, Occam’s razor, etc… can then be applied on top of the scientific method.
