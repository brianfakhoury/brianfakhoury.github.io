e:T430,A lot of DAOs implement a function in their smart contracts called ragequit. This function serves simply to let any DAO member call it, and immediately remove themselves from the DAO, receiving their pro rata assortment of assets. This is remarkable in a number of ways! Let’s think of a real-world example where a partnership agreement specifies in writing how a member could leave and take their share of money out of the company. Traditionally, if all goes well, paperwork is signed, and in a few days, all is well and on its way. Some of the assets might be hard to liquidate or split up, but it’ll get sorted. In another scenario where there is a dispute on the terms, lawyers involved and all, leaving a partnership might take months and be very expensive! The ragequit function is agnostic to all this. The second it’s called, assets are transferred according to the rules, no papers are signed, no one even has to check! This can all happen within a few seconds. Most importantly, it’s agnostic to how anyone feels. An unruly member can’t get in the way.2:["$","article",null,{"className":"prose prose-stone dark:prose-invert text-pretty break-words mx-auto","children":[["$","header",null,{"children":[["$","time",null,{"dateTime":"2021-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","className":"block mb-5 text-sm","children":"May 4, 2021"}],"$undefined",["$","h1",null,{"className":"first-letter:font-greatVibes","children":"The Future is DAO: A Primer on DAOs and Their Explosive Growth"}],["$","aside",null,{"className":"text-xs","children":["Originally published at"," ",["$","$L7",null,{"href":"https://underscore.vc/blog/the-future-is-dao-a-primer-on-daos-and-their-explosive-growth/","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"underscore.vc"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"rounded-lg absolute inset-0 max-w-screen-xl h-[550px] z-[-3] mx-auto overflow-hidden ","children":[["$","$Ld",null,{"src":"/images/future-is-dao/d905a4d16c09e3e636154d0f51054568_MD5.gif","alt":"The Future is DAO: A Primer on DAOs and Their Explosive Growth cover image","height":674,"width":1200,"className":"absolute inset-x-0 bottom-0 w-full h-3/4 object-cover z-[-2] m-0","priority":true}],["$","div",null,{"className":"absolute inset-0 z-10 bg-gradient-to-b from-background from-30%"}]]}]]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"relative mt-10","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"absolute -top-3 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 w-screen max-w-3xl h-96 rounded-lg bg-gradient-to-b from-background/40 to-background to-40% z-[-2]"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"first-letter:text-5xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:mr-2 first-letter:float-left pt-3","children":[["$","p","p-0",{"children":"One year ago, the world was learning to adapt to being digital-first.
