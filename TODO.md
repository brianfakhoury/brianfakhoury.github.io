**Things I want to add:**

- My note box (use new branch for development)
- MDX support (for writings but also to easily bring in stuff like `README` and `CHANGELOG`)
- Add a changelog and readme
- Make root og image generator and add profile photo overlay
- Add commenting via giscus
- Add html content to feeds
- Metadata inheritance, perhaps via `get-metadata.ts`
- Can I remove nextui? good library but tons of overhead it seems
- Need a way to view all tags. `/writing/all-tags`?
- Change prefix slash behavior for image paths in writing posts
- Add writing series functionality, and flesh out extra post properties.
- Make main page text an mdx thing.
- Remove global styles somehow, maybe just make it a utility or library function?
- Make this repo copy-able
- Fix links, change to next/link and sort out color/external
