**Things I want to add:**

- My note box (use new branch for development)
- MDX support (for writings but also to easily bring in stuff like `README` and `CHANGELOG`)
- Add a changelog and readme
- Add commenting via giscus
- Add html content to feeds
- Metadata inheritance, perhaps via `get-metadata.ts`
- Need a way to view all tags/categories on `/writing`
- Make main page text an mdx thing.
- Make this repo copy-able
