**Things I want to add:**

1. My note box (use new branch for development)
2. MDX support (for writings but also to easily bring in stuff like `README` and `CHANGELOG`)
3. Add a changelog and readme
4. Make root og image generator and add profile photo overlay
5. Add commenting via giscus
6. Add html content to feeds
7. Can I remove postcss.config?
8. Metadata inheritance, perhaps via `get-metadata.ts`
9. Can I remove nextui? good library but tons of overhead it seems
10. Need a way to view all tags. `/writing/all-tags`?
11. Change prefix slash behavior for image paths in writing posts
12. Add writing series functionality, and flesh out extra post properties.
13. Make main page text an mdx thing.
14. Remove global styles somehow, maybe just make it a utility or library function?
15. Make this repo copy-able
